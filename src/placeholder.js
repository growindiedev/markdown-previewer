const placeholder = `# Here you will find a wonderful React Markdown Previewer! (this is a h1 sized header!)

## Below you will find several different examples of how to use this editor! (this is a h2 sized header, note the number of # used to denote what h-number is used)

### Before we start, if you would like to see some of my other projects, check me out at my ) [GitHub](https://github.com/jarryingnut)!

You make \`<p>inline code</p>\` with backticks!

You can also make multiline code by using three backticks in the beginning and end of your code, like this:

\`\`\`
class App extends React.Componenet {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <span> This is so cool! </span>
    )
  }
}
\`\`\`

> Block Quotes will look like this!

- Lists are super simple as well!
   - Indentation will change your bullet point
1. And you can even number your list items!

**bold** text works like this...
and _italic_ like this...
**_or even both_** like this!
always be sure to ~~correct your mistakes~~


### Images will even work here!
